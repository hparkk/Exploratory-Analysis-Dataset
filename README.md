# Layoffs Data Analysis (2020â€“2023)

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of company layoffs from 2020 to 2023. The goal is to understand which companies, industries, and countries were most affected, how layoffs changed over time, and which stages of companies experienced the largest layoffs.

## How It Works
- **Data Aggregation:** Summarizes total layoffs by company, industry, country, and stage.  
- **Time Analysis:** Examines layoffs by date, month, and year, including rolling totals to see trends over time.  
- **Ranking:** Identifies the top 5 companies, industries, and countries per year.  
- **Volatility:** Measures variability of layoffs by industry to understand instability in different sectors.

The analysis is done entirely in **SQL**, using Common Table Expressions (CTEs), aggregation, ranking, and joins to create clear, comparable results across multiple years.

## Why It Matters
Understanding layoffs trends helps:
- Identify industries or countries most affected by workforce reductions.  
- Provide insights for economic and business research.  
- Track company growth, stability, and risks over time.  
- Support decision-making for investors, policymakers, and HR professionals.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore and understand patterns in layoffs across companies, industries, and countries over recent years. By analyzing the data:

- I can identify the **most affected companies and sectors**.  
- I can track **trends over time** to see how layoffs evolve during economic changes.  
- I can provide a **data-driven perspective** for business insights, research, or policy discussions.  

Ultimately, this project demonstrates how SQL and data analysis can be used to **transform raw data into actionable insights** and support decision-making in the business and economic context.
